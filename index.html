        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Shai Achdut AKA “ABRRA”, is a music producer and composer of original electronic music,
Located in midtown Jerusalem, Israel.

ABRRA started his musical journey during childhood, when he discovered his love and passion for electronic music, focusing on EDM & Psychedelic Trance genres. 
From that moment he quickly realized - that what’s important for him the most is a good groove & melodic sounds which move the body of the listener and create the interest and goosebumps that ABRRA’s music makes his listeners feel.
ABRRA started his original project with 2 melodic Releases of “Adele” & “Opera” that were played in different venues by various local & international artists.
In the beginning, he played in several different clubs in Tel-Aviv & Jerusalem and became a resident DJ at Cactus9 club in JLM, in collaboration and next to international electronic artists from Israel.
He plays a unique style that mixes House music with Indie music composed with Afro-House and electronic Melodies that make his signature of different sounds and styles in his art.
ABRRA’s debut EP was signed by “CRRCT” label and reached the top 100 list of 2 categories, both in Beatport:
Top 100 hype,
Top 100 Indie.

Shai is about to release more original music and special EP in the summer of 2024.

The stage, Shai says, is his escape and the best place for the soul to rest and to feel vividly alive, among the crowd that moves to his music, Shai states it’s the best satisfaction and thrill he has ever felt in his creation.
Whether it’s House, Techno, Indie-House or Afro-House,
ABRRA knows to mix them all to his unique sounds only he has - 
ABRRA House.
